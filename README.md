This is my multi user blog project site. I tried to reach the specifications for this site:
* accounts passwords are stored in sha256 format with secret word
* only registered accounts can create, like, remove and edit posts.

Design is bad, but at least i used bootstrap :)


Project is available on: https://udacity-multiblog-project.appspot.com.

Project also can be run locally with `gcloud app deploy` command.

I also created account: udacity/udacity for preview. My blog also has some sample posts.
